# Monica Android Backup Compatibility

This document defines the browser extension's compatibility contract with the current Monica Android WebDAV backup format.

## Authority

- Repository: `Monica-Pass/Monica`
- Audited committed baseline: `12de90beefea7ec5df243d55fa6254e171cf8b73`
- Backup writer/reader: `Monica for Android/app/src/main/java/takagi/ru/monica/utils/WebDavHelper.kt`
- Wallet codecs/models: `CardWalletDataCodec.kt` and `SecureItemModels.kt`
- Encryption: `EncryptionHelper.kt`
- Attachment formats: `AttachmentBackupCodec.kt` and `PortableAttachmentBackup.kt`

The extension treats data it does not edit as opaque Android-owned data. Compatibility does not depend on the provider-neutral extension model knowing every Android field.

## Feature Parity Matrix

The status vocabulary is intentionally strict:

- **Full**: the extension can create, read, edit, delete, and test the browser equivalent.
- **Data**: the extension can inspect or manage the portable record while retaining Android-only fields.
- **Preserved**: the Android payload remains byte-identical but has no browser equivalent.
- **Planned**: the browser equivalent is part of this compatibility epic and must not be described as complete yet.

| Android feature group | Browser status | Compatibility requirement | Acceptance evidence |

| Secure notes | Full | Content, tags, Markdown and image references | Markdown/tags manager E2E (`tests/e2e/wallet.spec.ts`), Bitwarden `monica_note_*` carrier fields, `imagePaths` preserved in WebDAV and KeePass codecs (Android-local image references stay metadata) |
| Passkeys | Full | Browser/Bitwarden keys are usable; Android aliases remain metadata-only | WebAuthn E2E and source-mode tests |
| Password generator/history | Data | Browser generator works; Android generated history can be reviewed and individually deleted while future fields remain portable | Generator unit/E2E tests and ZIP byte checks |
| Categories/favorites/order | Data | Category IDs/names are resolved for active and trash records; new categories are appended without rewriting existing metadata | Migration and codec tests |
| Operation timeline | Data | The unlocked manager reads operation summaries and field names; old/new values and device IDs stay in the background boundary | Codec, sender-policy and UI tests |

| Android IME/permissions/launcher settings | Preserved | No false browser equivalent; configuration survives backup rewrites | Compatibility inventory test |
| Monica Plus/payment | Preserved | No entitlement or payment behavior is inferred by the extension | Compatibility inventory test |

The matrix is re-audited whenever the Android reference commit changes. A feature may move to **Full** only after its acceptance evidence runs in the release check.

## Golden Fixtures

`tests/fixtures/android/forward-compatible-record.json` is a sanitized file-based fixture containing a recognized record with future outer and nested fields plus an unknown binary entry. The larger current-shape fixture remains generated in `android-backup-codec.test.ts` so timestamps and binary payloads are deterministic. Together they cover current, legacy, malformed, encrypted, empty-password, duplicate-ID, and forward-compatible records.

## Container and Encryption

Android stores a ZIP directly or wraps the ZIP in this binary envelope:

| Offset | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `0..12` | UTF-8 `MONICA_ENC_V1` |
| next 32 bytes | PBKDF2 salt |
| next 12 bytes | AES-GCM IV |
| remainder | AES-256-GCM ciphertext and 128-bit tag |

The key is PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 100,000 iterations and a 256-bit output. Extension parameters match Android exactly.

## Recognized Record Fields

All outer and nested fields not listed as editable remain in the original JSON object/string.

### Passwords

Android currently writes:

`id`, `title`, `username`, `password`, `website`, `notes`, `isFavorite`, `categoryId`, `categoryName`, `appPackageName`, `appName`, `email`, `phone`, `keepassDatabaseId`, `keepassGroupPath`, `bitwardenVaultId`, `bitwardenFolderId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `authenticatorKey`, `passkeyBindings`, `sshKeyData`, `loginType`, `ssoProvider`, `ssoRefEntryId`, `customIconType`, `customIconValue`, `customIconUpdatedAt`, `wifiMetadata`, and `customFields[]` (`title`, `value`, `isProtected`).

The extension edits the common login subset. App binding, personal fields, SSO/Wi-Fi/SSH metadata, icon metadata, ownership fields, and any future fields remain untouched.

### Secure-item outer object

TOTP, cards, documents, billing addresses, payment accounts, and notes share:

`id`, `itemType`, `title`, `itemData`, `notes`, `isFavorite`, `imagePaths`, `keepassDatabaseId`, `keepassGroupPath`, `bitwardenVaultId`, `bitwardenFolderId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, and `categoryName`.

`itemData` is a JSON string. It must not be parsed and re-encoded unless a nested field actually changes.

### TOTP `itemData`

Current fields are `secret`, `issuer`, `accountName`, `period`, `digits`, `algorithm`, `otpType`, `counter`, `pin`, `link`, `associatedApp`, `customIconType`, `customIconValue`, `customIconUpdatedAt`, `boundPasswordId`, `categoryId`, `keepassDatabaseId`, and Steam metadata (`steamFingerprint`, `steamDeviceId`, `steamSerialNumber`, `steamSharedSecretBase64`, `steamRevocationCode`, `steamIdentitySecret`, `steamTokenGid`, `steamRawJson`).

Legacy `authenticatorKey` is accepted as the secret. The extension edits only the common TOTP subset and preserves OTP type, counter, PIN, binding, icon, and Steam fields.

### Bank-card `itemData`

Current fields are `cardNumber`, `cardholderName`, `expiryMonth`, `expiryYear`, `cvv`, `bankName`, `cardType`, `billingAddress`, `brand`, `nickname`, `validFromMonth`, `validFromYear`, `pin`, `iban`, `swiftBic`, `routingNumber`, `accountNumber`, `branchCode`, `currency`, `customerServicePhone`, and `customFields`.

Accepted legacy aliases include `number`, `expMonth`, `expYear`, `code`, `fromMonth`, and `fromYear`.

### Document `itemData`

Current fields are `documentType`, `documentNumber`, `fullName`, `issuedDate`, `expiryDate`, `issuedBy`, `nationality`, `additionalInfo`, `title`, `firstName`, `middleName`, `lastName`, `address1`, `address2`, `address3`, `city`, `stateProvince`, `postalCode`, `country`, `company`, `email`, `phone`, `ssn`, `username`, `passportNumber`, `licenseNumber`, and `customFields`.

Accepted legacy aliases include `type`, `number`, `issueDate`, `issuingAuthority`, `name`, `state`, and `driverLicense`.

### Billing-address `itemData`

Current fields are `fullName`, `company`, `streetAddress`, `apartment`, `city`, `stateProvince`, `postalCode`, `country`, `phone`, `email`, `isDefault`, and `customFields`.

Legacy aliases include `name`, `organization`, `address1`, `addressLine1`, `address2`, `addressLine2`, `state`, `province`, `region`, `zip`, `zipCode`, and `phoneNumber`.

### Payment-account `itemData`

Current fields are `paymentType`, `provider`, `accountName`, `accountHolderName`, `email`, `phone`, `username`, `accountId`, `maskedAccountNumber`, `linkedCardLast4`, `routingNumber`, `iban`, `swiftBic`, `billingAddress`, `website`, `currency`, `notes`, `isDefault`, and `customFields`.

Legacy aliases include `type`, `accountType`, `service`, `brand`, `network`, `name`, `nickname`, `title`, `holderName`, `fullName`, `nameOnAccount`, `phoneNumber`, `userName`, `login`, `accountIdentifier`, `id`, `maskedNumber`, `accountNumber`, `cardLast4`, `last4`, `swift`, `bic`, `url`, `uri`, and `memo`.

### Notes

Current `itemData` fields are `content`, `tags`, and `isMarkdown`. Only `content` is mapped into the extension model; tags and Markdown state remain untouched.

### Passkeys

Android currently writes `credentialId`, `rpId`, `rpName`, `userId`, `userName`, `userDisplayName`, `publicKeyAlgorithm`, `publicKey`, `privateKeyAlias`, `createdAt`, `lastUsedAt`, `useCount`, `iconUrl`, `isDiscoverable`, `isUserVerificationRequired`, `transports`, `aaguid`, `signCount`, `notes`, `boundPasswordId`, `passkeyMode`, and `categoryName`.

`privateKeyAlias` is an Android key reference, not PKCS#8 key material. The extension must preserve it but cannot use it for browser WebAuthn signing.

### Generator history

Android writes at most 50 entries with `password`, `timestamp`, `packageName`, `domain`, `username`, and `type`. Recognized types are `SYMBOL`, `PASSWORD`, `PASSPHRASE`, `PIN`, and `AUTOFILL`. The unlocked manager masks values until explicitly revealed. Deleting one entry retains the Android filename and every unknown member of retained entries; malformed or oversized history remains byte-identical and is not editable.

### Special login records

Wi-Fi, SSH key, SSO and barcode records remain password entries whose `loginType` controls interpretation. WebDAV edits update only the mapped password fields; the existing ZIP path, unknown outer members and unknown nested metadata remain unchanged.

Bitwarden login ciphers use encrypted Monica carrier fields. `monica_login_type` identifies `WIFI`, `SSH_KEY`, `SSO` or `BARCODE`; `monica_wifi_data` carries the Android Wi-Fi JSON; SSO uses `monica_sso_provider` and `monica_sso_ref_entry_id`; SSH uses the `monica_ssh_*` field family and keeps the private key hidden. These carrier names are reserved system fields and are not duplicated as user custom fields.

KeePass uses `MonicaLoginType`, `MonicaWifiData`, `SSID`, the SSO fields and the Monica SSH field family. A bare KeePass `SSID` remains accepted as Wi-Fi for KeePass2Android compatibility. Barcode content stays in the protected password field, with `MonicaLoginType=BARCODE` preventing it from being decoded as a normal website login.

QR rendering uses the existing local QR encoder. Code 128 rendering dynamically loads the pinned `bwip-js` implementation only when selected; payloads never leave the extension and are limited to 4,096 characters.

## Write Rules

1. If the provider-neutral item is unchanged, do not replace its ZIP entry bytes.
2. If an item changes, update only changed mapped fields.
3. Do not normalize, default, or change the JSON type of unrelated fields.
4. Preserve existing path, category directory, ID, and filename.
5. Keep unknown JSON members, nested members, arrays, `null` values, and legacy aliases.
6. Keep every unknown/binary ZIP entry intact.
7. New extension records use current canonical Android field names under `folders/_root/`.
8. Never claim an Android `privateKeyAlias` is a browser-usable Passkey private key.
